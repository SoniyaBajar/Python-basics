'''
Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow the code written by somebody else in our python program.
1. Bulid-in modules: Ready to import and use with the python interpreter, there is no need to install such modules explicitly.
2. External modules: which are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. 
It installs whatever the module you ask for from the internet in your python interpreter.
*The pip command
pip means install packages .It can be used as a package manager to install the external python modules. e.g. panda.
#syntax of print function: write the strings(words) in double quotation whereas you can right numbers directly.
*Using (Ctrl+/ ) you can comment and uncomment to any code base. So, if you have to remove anything , a large part of code etc. ,
then you can easily remove it by  selecting it & (Ctrl+?) . You can also use triple single-quote mark for multi-line comment.
'''
print("hello world")
print(6)
print(18*45) #you can also comment here like this, means even after a code.
#for multi-line comment, you can also use triple single-quote like this.
#separator parameter sep="any separator"
#e.g.
print("hii",5,6,sep="~")
# it will give--- hii~5~6
#end parameter
print("hii",2,3,end="344")
#result: hii 2 3344 
# if you do not use next line after 'end', then next print line will print just after it whereas in general print statements ,next line is obvious for the system.
#escape sequence character

















a=complex(8,2) #8+2i 
print(10/2.5) #it will give 4.0
#floor division operator(//), module operator(%) & exponential operator(**)
print(5//2) #it will give quotient,2. 
print(5%3) #it will give remainder,2. 
print(5**3) #it means 5 raise to power 3, 5*5*5
# (Alt+shift+down arrow) is shortcut for VScode to replicate a line.
