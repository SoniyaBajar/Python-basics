#syntax of print function: write the strings(words) in double quotation whereas you can right numbers directly.
print("hello world")
print(6)
print(18*45) #you can also comment here like this, means even after a code.
'''
for multi-line comment, you can also
use triple single-quote
like this
'''
#separator parameter sep="any separator"
#e.g.
print("hii",5,6,sep="~")
# it will give--- hii~5~6
#end parameter
print("hii",2,3,end="344")
#result: hii 2 3344 
# if you do not use next line after 'end', then next print line will print just after it whereas in general print statements ,next line is obvious for the system.
#escape sequence character
